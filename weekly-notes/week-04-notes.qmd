# Data visualization & exploratory

## why visualization matters

bias in visualization
summary can hide some important details
example: Anscombe’s Quartet

-	can not get ACS for census block, only decenial 
-	census block groups have big margin of error (ACS), T island problem
-	census tracts are better

the smaller of the sample, the bigger margin of error 

## Grammar of Graphics
ggplot ( data = your_data ) + aes ( x = variable1, y = variable2 ) + geom_something ( ) + additional_layers (color… )

aes:
-	X,y
-	color
-	fill
-	size
-	shape
-	alpha _ transparency

## exploratory data analysis
-	distribution

## join
-	left join is preserve the table at first (often option)
-	right join …. The second table
-	full join is to preserve all the tables (necessary sometimes)
-	inner joint is to find the result held by both tables
