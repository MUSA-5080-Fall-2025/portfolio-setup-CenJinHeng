# Model Diagnostics & Spatial Autocorrelation

## rendering issues
- Add **progress = FALSE** in each function call
- Set globally on the top of the doc
```{r}
# Add this near the top of your .qmd after loading libraries
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
options(tigris_progress = FALSE)  # Suppress tigris progress bars
```
- evaluation and echo
```{r example1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# eval = true, run the code; echo = true, show the result
```

# regression evaluation
- good error is random

# Moran's I
- measure spatial autocorrelation
  - +1 shows that has positive correlation (cluster)
  - 0 random
  - -1 shows that has negative correlation (dispersion)

# Neighbors
- Queen: share the same border and corner
- rook: share the same border
