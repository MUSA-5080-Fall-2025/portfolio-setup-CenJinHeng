# Introduction to Linear Regression (Week 5)

## 1. Statistical Learning Framework
- Goal: Estimate the function **f(X)** that relates predictors (X) to an outcome (Y).
- Model: **Y = f(X) + ε**
  - f(X): systematic relationship (fixed but unknown)
  - ε: random error (irreducible)
- Two main approaches:
  - **Parametric**: assumes a specific form (e.g., linear), easier to interpret.
  - **Non-parametric**: flexible, requires more data, harder to interpret.
- Linear regression is a **parametric** method assuming linearity.

## 2. Purposes of Modeling
- **Inference**: understand how X affects Y.
  - Focus on coefficients and statistical significance.
- **Prediction**: estimate Y for new observations.
  - Focus on accuracy, not interpretation.
- A model can be statistically good but ethically harmful.

## 3. Model Building and Evaluation
- **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: estimates βs minimizing squared errors.
- Example: median income ~ population (PA counties).
- **Interpretation**:
  - β₀ = intercept (baseline)
  - β₁ = change in Y for one-unit change in X
- **R²**: proportion of variance explained (in-sample fit).
  - In-sample fit ≠ out-of-sample performance.
- **Overfitting**: too complex, fits noise.
- Use **train/test split** or **cross-validation (CV)** to evaluate generalization.
  - 10-fold CV provides more stable estimates.
  - Key metrics: RMSE, MAE, R².

## 4. Model Assumptions and Diagnostics
Linear regression assumptions:
1. **Linearity**: relationship between X and Y is linear.
   - Check residual plot → random scatter = good.
2. **Constant variance (Homoscedasticity)**:
   - Violations → heteroskedasticity.
   - Check with Breusch-Pagan test.
3. **Normality of residuals**:
   - Use Q-Q plot.
   - Matters for inference, less for prediction.
4. **No multicollinearity** (only in multiple regression):
   - Check Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
5. **No influential outliers**:
   - Check Cook’s D and leverage.
   - Investigate, don’t automatically remove.

## 5. Improving the Model
- Add more predictors (education, poverty rate, etc.).
- Use **transformations** (e.g., log) to handle nonlinearity.
- Include **categorical variables** (e.g., metro/non-metro).
- Always re-check assumptions after modifications.

## 6. Ethical and Analytical Awareness
- Model quality ≠ fairness.
- Outliers may represent important or marginalized cases.
- Never remove data points without investigation.
- Evaluate model implications in policy contexts.

## 7. Regression Workflow Summary
1. Understand problem and define goal.
2. Visualize relationships.
3. Fit the model.
4. Evaluate fit and predictive performance.
5. Check assumptions and diagnostics.
6. Refine with transformations or added variables.
7. Consider ethical implications.
