Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n\ncensus_tracts_joined <- census_tracts_joined %>%\n  mutate(\n    percentage_65 = pop_65/total_populationE\n  )\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- census_tracts_joined %>%\n  filter(median_household_incomeE < 48000,\n         percentage_65 > 0.20\n         )\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\nFor the income threshold, I chose 48,000 based on the 2025 poverty guidelines by the USCIS. For a family with four people, 150% of the federal poverty level is $48,225.\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\nFor the age threshold, I chose the percentage of people over 65 years old is over 20%, which can be seen as an elderly community.\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n126\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\nthe percentage of vulnerable tracts = 126 / 3445 = 3.66%\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n\nvulnerable_tracts_proj <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  st_transform(5070) # 5070 is for the whole country.

Why or why not?\nNo, I looked at the distance data of the vulnerable tracts, most of them (92.9%) are under 10 miles (16000m). I think 15 miles is a very big number, so we just have one tract fulfill all the requirements.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\nvulnerable_tracts_proj <- st_transform(vulnerable_tracts_proj, st_crs(pa_counties))\nundeserved  <- st_transform(undeserved , st_crs(pa_counties))\n\ncounties_num = census_tracts %>%\n  st_centroid() %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties%>% select(COUNTY_NAM)) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_tract =  n(),\n  )%>%\n  arrange(n_tract)\n\ncounties_vuln <- vulnerable_tracts_proj %>%\n  st_centroid() %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties%>% select(COUNTY_NAM)) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_vuln =  n(),\n    avg_dist_vuln_mi = mean(dist_to_hospital_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vuln_pop = sum(pop_65, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(total_vuln_pop))\n\ncounties_unders <- undeserved %>%\n  st_centroid() %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties%>% select(COUNTY_NAM)) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_unders =  n(),\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n_unders))\n\n\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\ncounties_stat = counties_num %>%\n  left_join(counties_vuln, by = \"COUNTY_NAM\") %>%\n  left_join(counties_unders, by = \"COUNTY_NAM\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    percentage_unders = n_unders / n_vuln,\n    percentage_vuln = n_vuln / n_tract\n  )%>%\n  arrange(desc(percentage_vuln))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\nCAMERON is the highest, with 100% in the number.\nSince I only have 1 underserved tract, I would show top 5 counties with the highest percentage of vulnerable tracts:\n(1) CAMERON 50.0%\n(2) FAYETTE 19.4%\n(3) CAMBRIA 19.0%\n(4) JEFFERSON 15.4%\n(5) WARREN 15.4%\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\nPHILADELPHIA, with the number of 18022\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\nSince I only have 1 underserved tract, I would observe patterns of vulnerable counties.\n(1) Most of them are from rural areas with less tracts number, so they have higher percentage of vulnerable tracts\n(2) They have large numbers of vulnerable population, which means lots of low-income and old people living there. Most of them have number over 1000. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create and format priority counties table\n# metrics for the priority: vulnerable index = normalized_number_of_vulnerable_tracts*0.3 +

All of them are up_to_date. The crime incidents data is from 2024, because we are in the October of the 2025, so we don't have data for the whole 2025. Using 2024 can avoid some time variation.\n- How many features does it contain?\nAll of them have geometry, which means we can run them in spatial analysis. For the school data set, we got names, types, grade levels, phone numbers, street names, and zip codes. For the crime data, we have precise time, crime types, location details. For the bike network data, we knew street names, types, lengths and oneway.  \n- What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\nEPSG:2272, which is used in south Pennsylvania.\n\n---\n\n2. **Pose a research question**\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?\"\n- \"Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?\"\n- \"Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?\"\n\nMy question is **\"Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?\"**\n\n---\n\n3. **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):**\n\n- Buffers\n- Spatial joins\n- Spatial filtering with predicates\n- Distance calculations\n- Intersections or unions\n- Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Your spatial analysis\n\n# I have loaded data sets and make simple statistical

Appropriate CRS transformations\n- Summary statistics or counts\n- At least one map showing your findings\n- Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\n\n**Your interpretation:**\n\nSchool zones have fewer crime incidents and bike lane length compared to city average. More pedestrian-friendly projects should be applied to school areas. For the spatial difference, higher concentrations of crimes are observed around schools in central and southern Philadelphia. School zones with longer bike lane coverage are mostly located in the city’s core and western areas. Planning efforts should focus on improving safety in school zones with higher crime risks, especially in central and southern Philadelphia. Expanding connected and protected bike lanes around schools can promote safer and more accessible environments for students.\n\n\n## Finally - A few comments about your incorporation of feedback!\nTake a few moments to clean up your markdown document and then write a line or two or three about how you may have incorporated feedback that you recieved after your first assignment. \n\nI need to hide my API Key and printed tables!\n\n---\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n**What to submit:**\n\n1. **Rendered HTML document posted to your course portfolio** with all code, outputs, maps, and text\n   - Use `embed-resources: true` in YAML so it's a single file\n   - All code should run without errors\n   - All maps and charts should display correctly\n\n**File naming:** `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.html` and `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2.qmd`\n\n---\n\n",
